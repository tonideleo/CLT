CLT - Classical Lamination Theory

This is an object-oriented code written in Matlab as a tool for analyzing classical lamination theory problems.

So far it is composed by 3 main classes:

1)  CLT_Material
    This class will handle all the material aspect of the laminate.

2)  CLT_Ply
    All the operation at ply level (local stresses in X-Y or 1-2 directions) are done here.

3)  CLT_Laminate
    This class will manage and merge all the plies created with the two previous classes. 
    Multiple methods are available to help implementing books' equations and computational methods.

This README.md file will be updated shortly with most of the function descriptions!
